           snapping tolerance in Snapping options (Settings -> Snapping Options)
    0.2.5: - snapping of first point of lines allowed ..., CTRL key has to be pressed

    0.3.1: make opening of the optional feature form modal, with auto-deleting
             of feature on Cancel (same behavior as main digitizing tools)
           add property to ignore clicks when tool is active, keeping the tool
             from registering clicks when they occur outside of a modal dialog
           fix tool not switching to correct geometry when switching between
             layers in edit mode
           add some transparency to tool's rubberband and set color for polygon
             similar to that of main digitizing tools
